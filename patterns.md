### Two pointers

If one person want to get thing in terrace need to climb 10 steps, if someone in terrace bring down and this person also climb up then 5 steps each which is similar to two pointers.

- array or Linkedlist
- sorted data(nu) (if index asked cannot use this way - sorted will change index) Number - we can sort/ index - already sorted array
- merge (inplace)/ remove duplicate/ rearrange/ subarray
- linkedlist -> detect cycle
- find pair/ triplet/ quadraples (find more than one thing)
- take effort but reduce time
